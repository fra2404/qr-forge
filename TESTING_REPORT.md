# QR Forge - Cross-Architecture Testing Report

## Overview

This document contains the testing results for QR Forge Homebrew formula across different architectures.

## ARM64 (Apple Silicon) - ✅ PASSED

**Test Environment:**

- Platform: macOS (Darwin)
- Architecture: arm64 (Apple Silicon M-series)
- Homebrew Version: 4.5.8-117-g019a799
- Test Date: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

**Test Results:**

- ✅ Formula syntax validation
- ✅ Installation from source (`cargo install`)
- ✅ Binary functionality (help, version, QR generation)
- ✅ Format support (PNG, SVG)
- ✅ Custom parameters (size, margin, colors)
- ✅ Performance (~0.2s per QR code)
- ✅ Official Homebrew test suite
- ✅ File generation verification
- ✅ Cross-format compatibility

**Sample Output:**

```
🔧 Generating QR code for: https://github.com/fra2404/qr-forge
📊 Parameters:
   - Size: 300x300 pixels
   - Error correction: H
   - Margin: 4 modules
   - Format: png
📊 File size: 3.79 KB
✅ QR code generated successfully!
```

## AMD64 (Intel x86_64) - ⏳ TESTING NEEDED

To test QR Forge on Intel-based systems:

### Prerequisites

- Intel-based Mac or Linux system with x86_64 architecture
- Homebrew installed
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fra2404/qr-forge.git
cd qr-forge

# Run quick architecture test
./quick_test.sh
```

### Comprehensive Test (10 minutes)

```bash
# Run full test suite
./test_homebrew.sh
```

### Expected Results on AMD64

The test should produce similar results to ARM64:

- Formula syntax should validate ✅
- Installation should complete successfully ✅
- All functionality tests should pass ✅
- Performance should be comparable (~0.2-0.5s per QR code) ✅

## Cross-Architecture Compatibility

QR Forge uses Rust's `cargo install` which provides excellent cross-platform compatibility:

- **ARM64 (Apple Silicon)**: ✅ Tested and verified
- **AMD64 (Intel x86_64)**: ⏳ Ready for testing
- **Linux ARM64**: 🔄 Should work (Rust cross-compilation)
- **Linux x86_64**: 🔄 Should work (Rust cross-compilation)

## Rust Dependencies Compatibility

All dependencies are cross-platform compatible:

- `qrcode`: Pure Rust QR code generation
- `image`: Cross-platform image processing
- `clap`: Cross-platform CLI parsing
- `egui/eframe`: Cross-platform GUI (when used)

## Testing Instructions for Contributors

If you have access to an Intel-based system, please help validate:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Run the quick test**: `./quick_test.sh`
3. **Report results** by creating an issue with:
   - Architecture: `uname -m`
   - Platform: `uname -s`
   - Test output
   - Any errors encountered

## Continuous Integration

The project includes GitHub Actions for automated testing, currently focused on:

- ✅ macOS (latest) - primarily ARM64
- 🔄 Future: Add Intel runners if needed
- 🔄 Future: Add Linux testing

## Conclusion

QR Forge has been thoroughly tested on ARM64 and is ready for Homebrew Core submission. The Rust ecosystem's excellent cross-platform support provides high confidence for AMD64 compatibility.

**Status: Ready for Homebrew Core submission with ARM64 validation ✅**
